Make sure to replace "your_database_name", "your_username", and "your_password" with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials. Also, ensure that you have the psql command-line tool installed on your system.

Save the script to a file, for example, create_database.sh, and make it executable by running chmod +x create_database.sh in the terminal. Then you can execute the script using ./create_database.sh.

The script will connect to the PostgreSQL server, create a new database, and then create the "users" table with the specified columns.
